  <p>
    I'm excited that you're here! Feel free to explore. Constructive critique is always appreciated.
    I have been coding for a year now , and I really enjoy it. What excites me most about coding is how challenging it is.
    As much as I like learning on my own, I also love community.There's nothing quite like learning from other people.
    I'm hoping to venture into a software development career, but I also would like to broaden my horizons.
